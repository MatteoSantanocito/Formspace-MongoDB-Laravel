## Social media has never been so useful!

Form Space is the new social network that aims at mutual help between users. Do you have any doubts? Not sure how to make a triple integral? Don't worry, just ask!

## Features
![screenshot](screenshot/homepage-mobile.png) 

- Modern and quick to use design (my grandmother approves!)
- Leave a comment to help any users in trouble
- Version 2.0 has brought a big news (useful?): The possibility to search comfortably any song by entering the title or the artist!
Do you mind looking for it on Spotify? No fear! Just click a button and you will be automatically redirected to the Spotify site
- Not satisfied? What did you expect in only 1 weeks? I'm alone, I don't have a development team like Facebook!

## Licenza

**The site is free, you can easily steal it!**
